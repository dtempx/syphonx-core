BUG: key is empty for invalid-select error "Select requires one of"

use __ prefix for all internal vars

refactor context to into a private var
    reconsider _page and _step vars
    reconsider keypath()

add an each action that queries and dispatches to subactions


refactor to a visitor pattern for selection, preverification, and re-entry
populate nodes in result for dom tracking (see todos: translate result.nodes nodes to ids)


what is the difference between `"limit": null` and `"all": true`?
consider adding support for capturing HTML tables
