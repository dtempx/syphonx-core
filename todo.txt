The distinct option is a boolean flag on a Select action. If enabled it will apply a filter to remove duplicate values. The problem is it can only handle an array of strings or numbers, not an array of objects. 


"query": [["h3, p",["join"],["replace","/(\n)/gm",", "]]] (fenwick/person.json)

always yield after a click, so we generally don't need to worry about yielding at all
make replace action take simple string search and replace in addition to requiring a regex
distinct can only handle strings or numbers, not objects
see workaround for setting limit in repeat (_page_count+3) in greenbergglusker/person.json
make format=href default when attr=href
file url in template doesn't seem to work
document "query": [[".",["text","inline"]]] !!!

error retry handler in case script fails



get test/keypress working
calls to selectResolveValue need to be logged!!!!!! (2 places)
compute remaining timeout time for all yield actions (navigate, goback, locate, etc.)
json function should look for first and last {} or []

master timeoutadd simple waitfor switch option on selects
keypress
log context on every entry

repeat bug with mccarthy
basic input validation for template (is actions an array, is every action an object?, is every query a double array?)

allow a selector with no query and no value so long as there is a sub-select with a query or a value

overall timeout limit
format:href doesn't work with value defined selectors
filter doesn't appear to be truthy, unless it returns a boolen it may not work as expected
consider spreading data variables into evaluate so we can just do something like {name} instead of having to do {data.name}
    - unwrap new spread variables
    - leave data.variables wrapped as is for back-compat
when returning a null or undefined value from a select with repeated=true, [null] is always returned where just null is expected
intermediate _properties are being output

Template-driven/Declaritive Philosophy
Rationale






add encode and decode functions that calls encodeURIComponent and decodeURIComponent respectively
return which query was selected in output data
take screenshot for a selector
return bounding rect for a selector
support xpath selectors

select with subselect should work without a query on the select (workaround: set query to body)

window.post debugging feature!!

locator: pass additional options object
locator: append to controller log instead of console

maxSnooze and maxWaitfor setting that limits amount of time spent in those actions
return metrics containing snooze, waitfor, navigate, yield, total timers, as well as number of steps executed and skipped, also indicate how many timeouts occurred

DONE: consider trimming all strings, and all html
DONE: some functions like cut should accept numbers or bools as strings (example: coerce 2nd arg is a number that should also accept a string)
split on \n doesn't always work (repro: sgrlaw)
json function should have a second param to destructure the value

add a flag to extract function that returns all elements instead of just the first one (#syphonx 7/14, Taylor)
DONE: add a json function that does a JSON.parse without throwing if invalid
consider destructuring for json

DONE: add a test for parsing JSON
add a test to ensure immediate return with sleeps in offline mode

type action that inputs text

consider changing snooze to an object that can be named

add last waitfor time and whether it timed out
add amount of time for sleep's and waitfor's, navigate's

bug: harvester #315
bug: navigate stops immediately in a switch statement (#syphonx 7/18, Justin)


click with yield defers waitfor checks to re-entry
support dot format for selector names

test for attr, filter, attr
above only works when repeated is true (jp/rakuten/product_page.json)

test for click.yield (perkins)
debug commented out $filter code

add checks to deploy for version updated and committed





DONE: setup dist folder and package.json to hold different builds for node and browser
https://esbuild.github.io/api/#main-fields

remove whitespace after an opening tag and before a closing tag { data.replace(/>\s*/g, ">").replace(/\s*</g, "<") }

extractSync function for offline use only
use a packager like parcel to create the extract function so we can decompose the index.ts file and add unit tests

BUG: key is empty for invalid-select error "Select requires one of"

use __ prefix for all internal vars

refactor context to into a private var
    reconsider _page and _step vars
    reconsider keypath()

add an each action that queries and dispatches to subactions


refactor to a visitor pattern for selection, preverification, and re-entry
populate nodes in result for dom tracking (see todos: translate result.nodes nodes to ids)


what is the difference between `"limit": null` and `"all": true`?
consider adding support for capturing HTML tables
fetching non-existant attr causes error Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
refactor context so we can report output path at every step in the log output (reconsider context.name and keypath and when context.name is undefined)
