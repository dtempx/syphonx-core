use javascript for all formula evaluation (allowing multiple formulas within same string and passthru for single formula)
remove innerHTML and outerHTML variables to javascript evaluation, standarizing on upstream html method
remove startsWith and endsWith methods
add map method to allow javascript processsing in pipeline
change !{_ready} to {!_ready}


make transform queries singular
consider using formulas in when conditions


*** change all "transform" actions from [[]] to []
*** removed: first, last


error TS5055: Cannot write file 'z:/work/syphonx/syphonx-core/index.d.ts' because it would overwrite input file.
finalize "when" format... "when": "_click_news"   "when": "!_click_news"

extend context all the way down to resovleQueryOps and error so we can get the keypath name in the errors
    - may need to reconsider how context.name are defined from the root
    - also consider when name is undefined
    - already have a function called keypath which may be doing some of this

params
waitfor/select
repeat
complex conditions, example: "when": [["n", ">=", 5], "and", ["!ready"]]  or RPN:  "when": ["n", 5, ">=", "!ready", "and"]
complex names, example: "name": "foo.bar.baz"
filter private properties, example: "_ready"
rollup

look into whether :is() (which returns a boolean) is a replacement for exists

BUGS
fetching non-existant attr causes error Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
ikaun/ropers/person "$": [["img[src*='/attorney-headshots/_headshot/']",["attr","href"]]] 
null not returned when extract content is empty
"$": [["em"]] in zuckerman > publications --> "name": ""  -> "name": null

{"do": { "$": [[".atty-grid","remove"]] }} --> op.slice(...).map is not a function
"$": [["a",["attr","href"]] with "type": "object" --> eror



DOCUMENTATION
[".",["text","inline"]] --> useful in situations where you only want the top-level inline text content without the text from nested elements
:not(:blank)

VALIDATION
"select" with "type" not equal to "object"
