DONE: add new sync exports for select, transform, and extract

select with subselect should work without a query on the select (workaround: set query to body)

window.post debugging feature!!

locator: pass additional options object
locator: append to controller log instead of console

maxSnooze and maxWaitfor setting that limits amount of time spent in those actions
return metrics containing snooze, waitfor, navigate, yield, total timers, as well as number of steps executed and skipped, also indicate how many timeouts occurred

DONE: consider trimming all strings, and all html
DONE: some functions like cut should accept numbers or bools as strings (example: coerce 2nd arg is a number that should also accept a string)
split on \n doesn't always work (repro: sgrlaw)
json function should have a second param to destructure the value

add a flag to extract function that returns all elements instead of just the first one (#syphonx 7/14, Taylor)
DONE: add a json function that does a JSON.parse without throwing if invalid
consider destructuring for json

DONE: add a test for parsing JSON
add a test to ensure immediate return with sleeps in offline mode

type action that inputs text

consider changing snooze to an object that can be named

add last waitfor time and whether it timed out
add amount of time for sleep's and waitfor's, navigate's

bug: harvester #315
bug: navigate stops immediately in a switch statement (#syphonx 7/18, Justin)


click with yield defers waitfor checks to re-entry
support dot format for selector names

test for attr, filter, attr
above only works when repeated is true (jp/rakuten/product_page.json)

test for click.yield (perkins)
debug commented out $filter code

add checks to deploy for version updated and committed

allow a selector with no query and no value so long as there is a sub-select with a query or a value



DONE: setup dist folder and package.json to hold different builds for node and browser
https://esbuild.github.io/api/#main-fields

remove whitespace after an opening tag and before a closing tag { data.replace(/>\s*/g, ">").replace(/\s*</g, "<") }

extractSync function for offline use only
use a packager like parcel to create the extract function so we can decompose the index.ts file and add unit tests

BUG: key is empty for invalid-select error "Select requires one of"

use __ prefix for all internal vars

refactor context to into a private var
    reconsider _page and _step vars
    reconsider keypath()

add an each action that queries and dispatches to subactions


refactor to a visitor pattern for selection, preverification, and re-entry
populate nodes in result for dom tracking (see todos: translate result.nodes nodes to ids)


what is the difference between `"limit": null` and `"all": true`?
consider adding support for capturing HTML tables
fetching non-existant attr causes error Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
refactor context so we can report output path at every step in the log output (reconsider context.name and keypath and when context.name is undefined)
