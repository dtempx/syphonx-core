what is the difference between `"limit": null` and `"all": true`?
consider adding support for capturing HTML tables
fetching non-existant attr causes error Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')
refactor context so we can report output path at every step in the log output (reconsider context.name and keypath and when context.name is undefined)
