SyphonX works inside-out.
Most if not all other web scrapers work from the outside-in.

SyphonX is data-driven, not code-driven.
With most other web scrapers you have to write code, which requires developers.
With SyphonX you create a script which is more like a query where you describe the end result you want (not the procedure for getting it).
So it's declarative, not imperitive.
And as such it can be used by anyone, not just developers.
Zero dependencies
